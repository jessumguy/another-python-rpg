Made another text-based RPG to practice more Python OOP

# Mechanics:

1. Input player name
- Random stats (energy, money, intelligence and luck) are generated
2. Input an action: Sleep, Study, Work, Store
- Sleep to regain energy, Study and Work increases Intelligence and Money, but decreases energy.
- Store to purchase items
3. Buy items from store that give stat boosts and debuffs

# Thanks:

Special thanks for `agronholm` and others from the Python Discord community for taking the time to review and provide feedback on my code. Most notably, on recommending to have a separate Game.run() function, and looping it.
